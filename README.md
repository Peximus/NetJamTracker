A Win32 GDI Piano Roll and Drum Machine Tracker in C++ Using PortAudio.



Beta Version.

Effects:

Must set sample Rate to 44100Hz in Sound Settings.

You must build PortAudio to Compile, I use Visual Studio 2022 Community.

I have set the project configuration for PortAudio .lib files to C:\PortAudio\lib;
